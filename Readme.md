# Parser Test

Using best practice coding methods, build a console application that scrapes the Sainsburyâ€™s grocery site - Ripe Fruits page and returns a JSON array of all the products on the page.

Example JSON:

    {
        "results":
            [
                {
                    "title":"Sainsbury's Avocado, Ripe & Ready x2",
                    "size": "90.6kb",
                    "unit_price": 1.80,
                    "description": "Great to eat now - refrigerate at home 1 of 5 a day 1 avocado counts as 1 of your 5..."
                }, 
                {
                    "title":"Sainsbury's Avocado, Ripe & Ready x4",
                    "size": "87kb",
                    "unit_price": 2.00,
                    "description": "Great to eat now - refrigerate at home 1 of 5 a day 1 avocado counts as 1 of your 5..."
                } 
            ],
        "total": 3.80
    }
